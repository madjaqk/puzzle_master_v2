                <p>This meta was a lot of fun to brainstorm, and I think I captured a wide array of different "types" of combinations or partnerships.  Test Solution Bees Ignore is a puzzle solving teams that's well represented on the puzzle Discord I mostly wrote this set for; including them was incredibly indulgent on my part.</p>

                <p>I had a hard time brainstorming answers for this meta, especially after I decided I wanted to make the lengths within each category unique; ideally, each answer would have contributed a single letter to the final answer.  I didn't make any effort into making meta answers thematic, instead just assigning answers based on what letters I could extract, but as a coincidence, Milton Berle was known for performing in a dress, making him somewhat apt for the false feminines meta.</p>

                <p><strong>MAGGIE Q</strong> is the answer.</p>
                <p>I only know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule_(shoe)">mule</a> is a type of shoe from other puzzles, but it was one of the first I thought of while writing this.  It turns out that, as far as I could tell in my research, "mule" just means that it doesn't have a back, so many slippers and clogs are also mules, but I think the examples of those I found are unambiguous.  I believe MUGGLE was still the hardest answer in this (otherwise pretty easy) meta to place, so my apologies to anyone who bashed their head against it.</p>

                <p>Hoo boy--this meta turned out much more constrained than I expected.  Ideally I would have used both letters from every answer, but it just wasn't possible.  PAPAL LOOKS isn't a real phrase, like, at all, but I really, really needed the two Ls.  I believe some solvers got stuck because they noticed the repeated bigrams but not the double letters; in retrospect, just focusing on those probably would have been better.</p>

                    <li>From rule 1, row 1 must be all clubs.</li>
                    <li>For rule 5, the only 2 that's available is the 2 of clubs.  The king and ten of clubs aren't available, so this 2 must be adjacent to two non-clubs, which means it must be in row 2, directly beneath the 4 of clubs.</li>
                    <li>Per rule 3, the column that starts 4C, 2C, ??? can't be C or D, as there's no third card that could cause it to bust, and per rule 4 it can't be B.  Therefore A1 is the 4 of clubs and A2 is the 2 of clubs.</li>
                    <li>From that, B2 and A3 must be a king and 10, in some order.</li>
                    <li>Column B must include a ten-point card, so the only way it can total 14 is if B1 is the ace of clubs and B3 is one of the 3s.</li>
                    <li>C3 must be the other 3.</li>
                    <li>For column C to bust, C1 and C2 must sum to 19 or 20.  Given the cards available, C2 must be the ten of spades, the king of diamonds, or the king of hearts.</li>
                    <li>A3, B2, and C2 are 10S, KD, and KH in some order; in order to not violate rule 2, B2 must be 10S.</li>
                    <li>By process of elimination, D2 and D3 must be the 4 of diamonds and the 8 of hearts, in some order.  By rule 6, D3 must be the 8.</li>
                    <li>In order for column D to bust with the 8 and the 4, D1 must be a ten-point card, which can only be the jack of clubs.  C1 is thus the 9 of clubs.</li>
                    <li>Rule 1 forces the rest of the suits.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This was probably my favorite meta to write; brainstorming possible answers was a lot of fun, and I was surprised by how many reasonable phrases came out given that when I started it felt so constrained.  Unfortunately, one of those fantastic answers, ZEN GARDEN, proved ambiguous--I've never heard of a "garden club", but they apparently exist.  I also apologize that for BURN RATE and STRIP MINE, both halves can combine with a suit to make a phrase; in both cases only one half rhymes with a card rank, so it's technically unambiguous, but still more of a red herring than I would have liked.</p>

                <p>The answers were the singular form to avoid distinguishing between the Wolf Pack/Wolfpack/Red Wolves.  In addition, the Red Wolves and Golden Eagles are indicated by part of the respective box being the color.  The final grid:</p>

                <p>The extracted letters in order give <strong>MING-NA WEN</strong>.</p>
                <p>Anecdotally, I think this might have been most solvers' last meta, due to a combination of requiring somewhat specific domain knowledge and fiddly research.  My original idea was to use all sports, not just college football--my dream was a graph that connected LAKERS to CELTICS to RANGERS to ASTROS (that being NBA, Scottish football, and MLB), but it turns out most of the storied rivalries from American professional sports don't have names.  Take a page from college football and give wacky names and trophies to your classic showdowns, sports leagues!  I'm afraid that in an actual event, this would be highly, highly backsolvable, which thankfully wasn't a concern here.</p>
                <p>Other ideas I had for this meta were about Supreme Court cases and more general rivalries, but the former was basically <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2006/metas/washington.html">the Washington round from the 2006 MIT Mystery Hunt</a> and the latter <a href="https://pennypark.fun/puzzle/trainer/solution/">The Trainer from 2020</a>.</p>

                <p>One of the solvers mentioned that he didn't remember seeing this meta idea before, which seems hard to believe given how straightforward it is.  The only reason I can think of is that you're limited to five or six letters at most, given the paucity of recorded events that far back--SOPHIA NATURALIZATION ACT feels a little obscure to be an answer, but there's not much else for 1705.</p>

I wanted to include <em>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</em> as one of the movies, but it turns out Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston, and John Huston all worked on other movies with phonetic alphabet letters in the title (Walter Huston in <em>Yankee Doodle Dandy</em>, the other two on <em>High Sierra</em>).  I hope everyone had as much fun solving as I did writing these!</p>
